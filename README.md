Hey! I'm Jhéssiny Mattos 👋
Product Engineer focused on system design, scalable architecture, and applied AI.
Currently building a visual-first collaborative study platform — exploring real-time collaboration patterns, knowledge graphs, and AI-powered learning experiences.

🎯 What I Do
I design and build products at the intersection of thoughtful architecture, user-centered design, and applied AI. I care about systems that scale, patterns that last, and products that solve real problems.
Current focus: Real-time collaboration infrastructure, LLM integration, graph-based knowledge systems, event-driven architecture.
